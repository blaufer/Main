Repositories
------------
1. Alien Invasion - Game written in python for fun.
2. Band Character - Extra credit assignment for Modeling & Simulation that takes data generated from a program and uses Matlab to define the bands of crystalline structures based upon the amount of character gained from the s, p, d, and f orbitals.
3. Data and Databases - Code written during this class. The project was created by me and uses Microsoft Access to import data from my biochemistry lab in order to keep track of all aspects of research.
4. Excel Macros - Again, code written for my biochemistry lab and a class. The AMP Editor, AMP Finalizer, and Hydro Moment scripts will process the data gathered from mass spec and edit as needed and calculate multiple parameters. DOS Plot and Band Plot take data from a program and create the necessary graphs over multiple worksheets.
